Come to the Pizza Parlor and order yourself a wonderful Pizza! We have many sizes and toppings to choose from! Just tell us what you want from the menu and will give you a price!

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this Repository

# Specs

```js

Test: "It should create a Pizza object with properties of size, topping and price equaling 0"
Code: 
let pizzaOrder = new Pizza(0, 0);
Expected Output: 
pizzaOrder.size = 0;
pizzaOrder.topping = 0;
pizzaOrder.price = 0;

Describe: Pizza.prototype.calculatePrice()
Test: "It should return 0"
